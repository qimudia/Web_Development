            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h4> How does it work? </h4>
            <p> You send your request, we work with you on the design till you
                are satisfied, and you download your design. You can request as
                many revisions as you like until you are completely satisfied but
                it takes a longer period to complete.</p>

            <h4>What can I get designed?</h4>
            <p>You can get anything designed from your designer. Everything from
                logo, brochure, website, package design, flyers, t-shirts, trade
                show graphics and more.</p>

            <h4>What if I need hundreds of designs?</h4>

                on time. </p>

            <h4>How long does it take to receive designs?</h4>
            <p>Although we always meet our set goals but please, keep in mind that we
                value quality over everything else. Our designer will be in constant
                communication with you and will keep you updated on the status of
                your designs. Just keep in mind that larger and more complicated
                designs may take a little longer to finish.</p>

            <h4>How do you charge for your design?</h4>
            <p>The cost of design depends on your project or what you want to design.
                When you send us your request, we will give you a quote.</p>

            <h4>Can I cancel?</h4>
            <p>For cancellation, you will have to cancel your designs or graphics
                within the first 14 days and we will give you a full refund. </p>
